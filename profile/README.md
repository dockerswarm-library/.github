### Hi there 👋

Welcome to the Unofficial Container Image Library for Docker Swarm.

A collection of unofficial container image library designed specifically for using inside a Docker Swarm environment.  

A lot of the projects is currently still a work-in-progress and not well documented yet.  
Feel free to explore and try it out if you have experience using Docker Swarm and Docker Stack.

You should be able to figure out how thing works 😉
